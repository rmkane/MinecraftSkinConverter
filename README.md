## About

In Minecraft [release 1.8][1], [skin cutomization][2] was improved.

The size of the skin file was increased from [64 x 32 pixels][3] to [64 x 64 pixels][4]. The additional 32 pixels adds support for a full body overlay with independent left and right arms and legs. Instead of just a hat (head) overlay, you also have a jacket (body), sleeves (arms) and pants (legs).

The right and left arms and legs can now be edited independently. Previously, you could only edit the right arm and leg and they would be mirrored to produce the left arm and leg. 

## Build

In order to build this project, you will need to use [Eclipse][5] and [Gradle][6].
